# Object-Oriented-Programming---COP2931
Weekly courses from COP2931 Object Oriented Programming from Fall 2017. 
This course was taken at the University of South Florida under Professor Sulivan.
Major projects will also be placed in here. Note that not all weeks had assigned projects.

# Project List

## Week 1:
  [p1](week1_p1.cpp): Gets an integer and returns the integer.
  [p2](week1_p2.cpp): Takes a letter from the User and returns the letter after it.
  [p3](week1_p3.cpp): Converts from meters to feet.
  [p4](week1_p4.cpp): Calculates the simple interest based on the number of years, present value and interest rate.

## Week 2:
  [p1](week2_p1.cpp): Takes in two numbers and determines if they are equal, less than, or greater than each other.
  [p2](week2_p2.cpp): Determines the letter grade of a given percentage between zero and one hundred. 
  [p3](week2_p3.cpp): Calculates the average of three numbers. 
  [p4](week2_p4.cpp): Determines age based upon a set date of 3 September 2017. 
  
## Week 3: 
  [p1](week3_p1.cpp): Calculates the average grade for a class of no more than ten students. 
  [p2](week3_p2.cpp): Takes three numbers from the User and displays the numbers sorted from least to greatest. 
  [p3](week3_p3.cpp): Displays a pyramid of astericks. 
  [p4](week3_p4.cpp): Creates a chart from zero to one hundred degrees Fahenheit with a corresponding tempeture in Celsuis. 
  
## Week 5:
  [p1](week5_p1.cpp): Returns the minimum of three numbers.
  [p2](week5_p2.cpp): Takes in a number then returns the number in reverse.
  [p3](week5_p3.cpp): A game of Craps.
  
## Week 6:
  [p1](week6_p1.cpp): Determines the greatest common denominator (GCD) of two integers. 
  [p2](week6_p2.cpp): Determines the Fibonacci number at a given place in the Fibonacci Series. 
  [p3](week6_p3.cpp): Swaps two integers.
  [p4](week6_p4.cpp): Adds the given numbers together to get a sum. 
  
## Week 7:
  [p1](week7_p1.cpp): Determines if two arrays are identical, regardless of the order.
  [p2](week7_p2.cpp): Calculates the average grade in a class and tells how many students are above or below the average.
  [p3](week7_p3.cpp): Rolls two dice and displays a table of how many times each combination was rolled.
	
## Week 10: 
  [p1](week10_p1.cpp): Fills an array using pointers.
  [p2](week10_p2.cpp): Prints out an all uppercase version of "Take me to Clearwater beach!".
  [p3](week10_p3.cpp): Swaps two intergers using pointers.

## Week 11:
   [p1](week11_p1): An object oriented apporach to handling time. 
   [p2](week11_p2): Moves an elevator between floors. 
   
## [Project 2](Project2.cpp):
The program performs a cardtrick. It creates a random deck of cards, deals them out, picks them up, and then determines the secret card. 

## [Project 3](Project3.cpp):
The program simulates the checking out and checking in of books from a library.
